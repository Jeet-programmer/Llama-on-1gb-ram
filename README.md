Llama-2 7B
## Llama-2 7B on Replit
### Usage
This will *not* run from the cover page, you will need to fork it and click for yourself from your workspace.

The Repl will automatically download the correct model from huggingface and then run it, if it's running a little slow then please *boost* your Repl or grab a pro plan to get a bit more oomph in your Repl.

This Repl will grow to over **3GB** so you may need expandable storage to make it work!
